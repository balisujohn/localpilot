A very simple vscode extension for using codellama via oobabooga text generation webui. 

## Features

You select the text that is to be the prompt, then you call the "extendSelection" command and 10 characters are generated with codellama and appended. 

## Requirements

You need to be running a codellama model in text generation webui with the API mode enabled on the same machine for this extension to work. In addition, I recommend mapping ctrl-Q to the extendSelection command, since it isn't mapped to a keyboard command by default.

## Contributing
Since I just set this up so I could use it, it's not documented well and also may be difficult to set up, feel free to contribute improvements and instructions.
